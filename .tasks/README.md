# SQUI Implementation Tasks

This directory contains the task breakdown for implementing the SPARQL Query UI Web Component as specified in `docs/SPARQL Query UI Web Component Specification.pdf`.

## Task Organization

Tasks are organized into phases, with each task designed to:
- Be executable by AI agents
- Leave the project in a consistent, testable state
- Include appropriate tests
- Be committable with all tests passing

## Execution Order

Tasks should generally be executed in numerical order, as later tasks may depend on earlier ones. However, some tasks within a phase may be parallelizable.

## Task Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Tasks 01-05)
Project setup, basic UI structure, and Carbon Design System integration

### Phase 2: SPARQL Editor (Tasks 06-12)
